# Neural-Network

A perceptron is a type of neural network unit that performs calculations in order to recognise features or business intelligence in input data.

Dataset: To test perceptron models, an artificial dataset was constructed. The objective is to produce sets of k points (one for each class) at random and use the distance between these points to define the class or regression goal.

Method: I Linear perceptron, (ii) Single-Layer perceptron with backpropagation, and (iii) Multi-Layer perceptron with backpropagation have been built. I developed all of the algorithms from myself, without utilising any scikit-learn tools.
